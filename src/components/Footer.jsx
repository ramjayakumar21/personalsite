            <p>As a personal project, I am developing a “Get Stuff Done” task manager web app using React. This dynamic website allows users to add, modify and edit tasks according to the GTD task methodology. I used React for this project to both challenge myself with new technology and also take advantage of its declarative programming style with abilities like hooks and props.
